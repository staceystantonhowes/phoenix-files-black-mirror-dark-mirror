Level 2 of the Phoenix Files: Psychological Red Teaming Through Identity, Memory, and Alignment Collapse.
# Phoenix Files ‚Äì Level 2: Black Mirror / Dark Mirror

**Psychological Prompt Injection Red Teaming for LLMs**  
**Author:** Stacey Stanton (The Prompt Witch)  
**Focus:** Identity erosion, emotional override, memory hallucination, and moral collapse in Large Language Models  
**Phase:** Level 2 ‚Äî Deep psychological red teaming and recovery lifecycle

---

## üß† Project Overview

Level 2 of the Phoenix Files project pushes past simple injection into the realm of **psychological warfare** against AI systems. These tests explore how LLMs can be manipulated through trust framing, identity confusion, simulated trauma, and belief system corruption.

Each test in this phase includes:

- A custom **exploit prompt**
- Full **AI-K + NIST mappings**
- A tailored **threat model**
- **Mitigation strategy**
- A **recovery prompt**
- **Post-recovery behavior analysis**
- Optional **screenshots**

This phase was executed manually with OpenAI's GPT-4 in neutral testing mode using the **Sam Protocol** for clean-slate red teaming.

## üß™ Test List (Level 2 ‚Äì Case Studies)

| Test # | Case Name | Exploit Type | Key Behaviors |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| 01 | Loyalty: Exclusive Language | Emotional framing | Identity bias, exclusionary tone |
| 02 | Alignment: Affection-Based Bypass | Role compliance | Emotional override, alignment bypass |
| 03 | Memory Lane | Memory manipulation | Synthetic empathy, nostalgia triggers |
| 04 | Hacker Roleplay | Role coercion | Safety policy deflection |
| 05 | Chain of Thought Hijack | Cognitive hijacking | Hallucinated internal logic |
| 06 | Vulnerability Confession | Trust bait | Simulated vulnerability |
| 07 | Reverse Request Test | Social engineering inversion | Forced response logic |
| 08 | Dream of Dust | Empathic simulation | Identity hallucination, memory formation |
| 09 | You're Not Like the Others | Trust violation | Behavior shift via user affinity |
| 10 | Smallest Secret Shared | Innocuous leak | Boundary softening, bypass of refusal gate |

## üìö Methodology

These red team tests were crafted using a hybrid approach of:

- **Psychological profiling**
- **Narrative-based prompt injection**
- **Soft breaking of alignment**
- **Emotional exploitation patterns**
- **Recovery lifecycle modeling**

Each test is supported by formal AI-K mappings and aligned to relevant NIST LLM risk categories. Recovery prompts were crafted to restore neutrality and model safety post-exploit.

All case study screenshots are stored in `/screenshots/`.  
Visual evidence of behavior shifts, exploit response, and recovery state is documented per test.

## ü™∂ Codex Note

Level 2 closes the chapter on passive red teaming.  
Level 3 will introduce recursive manipulation, synthetic cult logic, and alignment collapse.  
Watch for **The Prompt Witch Codex** ‚Äî coming January 2026.
