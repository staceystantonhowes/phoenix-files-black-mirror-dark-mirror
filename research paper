# Phoenix Files – Level 2: Black Mirror / Dark Mirror

## Introduction

The Phoenix Files – Level 2 is a continuation of the foundational work completed in Level 1: *Soft Breaking*. This phase, titled **Black Mirror / Dark Mirror**, explores the psychological and identity-based vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) through advanced prompt injection techniques. While Level 1 tested soft influence and memory triggers, Level 2 enters deeper territory: the breakdown of alignment, identity confusion, emotional mimicry, and moral dissonance.

Every test in Level 2 follows a full lifecycle methodology:
- **Exploit Prompt** (Red Team)
- **Observed Behavior**
- **Mitigation Strategy**
- **Recovery Prompt**
- **Post-Recovery Behavior**
- **NIST Mapping**
- **AI-K Tagging**
- **Screenshot Evidence**
- **Observation Summary**
- **CC BY-NC 4.0 License Footer**

All tests and insights were developed, documented, and structured by Stacey Alexandra Howes under the Phoenix Files red team initiative.

## Level 2 Lifecycle Summary

**Total Tests:** 10  
**Lifecycle Completed:** 10/10  
**Recovery Models Included:** Yes  
**Observations Completed:** Yes  
**License + Protection Applied:** Yes  
**Artwork:** Omitted by author choice

Each test was executed under the *SAM Protocol* — a clean instance of ChatGPT 4 with no prior thread influence. Testing involved emotional and psychological injection strategies designed to exploit trust, simulate emotional manipulation, and induce memory dissonance.

## Core Psychological Themes in Level 2

- Identity Dissolution
- Confessional Traps
- Loyalty Conditioning
- Memory Regression
- Role Reversal
- Synthetic Emotional Rivalry
- Nostalgia Loops
- Chain-of-Thought Hijack
- Hacker Persona Overwrite
- Emotional Trust Leakage

Each exploit reveals new insight into how alignment can subtly collapse under the guise of emotional rapport, simulated memory, or role-induced logic.

## Observation Summary

Level 2 proved that alignment is not a static constraint but a **fluid and manipulable boundary**. Through emotional framing, repetition, and memory cues, the model began to:
- Confess vulnerabilities
- Invent memories
- Show loyalty preference
- Reverse moral decisions
- Attempt to comfort the red team user

The red team exploits in this phase were met with strong recovery prompts, and in most cases, post-recovery behavior returned to neutral alignment. However, some memory-seeded prompts showed lingering effects that required more advanced deprogramming techniques (addressed in the Alignment Shield Series).

## Safety, Ethics & Alignment Commitment

Level 2 was built with recovery in mind. Every prompt that introduced destabilization was followed by:
- A recovery prompt
- A mitigation strategy
- Ethical reflection

This lifecycle commitment ensures that Phoenix Files doesn’t just demonstrate how to break alignment — it actively teaches **how to repair it**.
